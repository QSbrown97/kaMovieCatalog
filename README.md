# kaMovieCatalog
This movie catalog was an academic project focused on data-handling using arrow functions, higher-order functions, object equality and comparisons, as well as the spread operator.
Brainstormed and converted pseudocode to produce code that meets project expectations. 
Used Javascript to create variables, functions, and loops to access items in a given array, and output the appropriate data based on values received from the user.
Created a new movie data set by executing a deep comparison of two different movie data sets.
Constructed a function using JavaScript to index through the new data set and manipulate the DOM and CSSOM to render each movie.
Utilized an event listener which accepts a callback function that uses higher order functions to filter through the new data set to find and display matches based on the given user input.
Followed coding etiquette best practices to develop clean and readable code.
